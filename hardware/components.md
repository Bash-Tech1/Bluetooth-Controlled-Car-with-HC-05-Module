## Safety Considerations

1. Always use a voltage regulator for the HC-05 module
2. Ensure proper heat sinking for the L298N if running motors at high current
3. Use appropriate wire gauge for motor connections
4. Include a power switch for easy control
5. Consider adding a fuse for overcurrent protection
6. Keep the battery pack secure and protected from short circuits

## Assembly Tips

1. Mount the Arduino and HC-05 module securely
2. Keep motor wires away from signal wires to reduce interference
3. Use heat shrink tubing or electrical tape for wire connections
4. Ensure the caster wheel is properly balanced
5. Test each component individually before final assembly
6. Secure the battery pack to prevent movement during operation
